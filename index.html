        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>Our suggestion box system is designed to gather valuable feedback and suggestions from you. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Explore the Navigation Bar: Use the navigation bar at the top to select the appropriate category for your suggestion. We have sections for administrators, prefects, teachers, chaplaincy, non-teaching staff, form period, and students.</li>
            <li>Fill Out the Form: Once you've selected a category, you'll be presented with a form. Fill in your suggestion in the provided field, and include your name for identification.</li>
            <li>Submit Your Suggestion: Click the "Submit" button to send us your suggestion. Your input is important to us, and we'll review it carefully.</li>
            <li>Re-visit: You can always come back to this page to check for updates on your suggestion or to submit more feedback.</li>
        </ol>
